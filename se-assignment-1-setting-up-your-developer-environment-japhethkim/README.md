#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.


 steps I took to set up my development environment for this assignment.

Software

Configuration

Git

Configured Git with my username and email using git config --global user.name "japheth" and git config --global user.email "[Your Email Address]"
Visual Studio Code:

Installed the following extensions to enhance functionality:
Python extension for syntax highlighting and linting
GitLens for improved Git integration within the IDE
Sample Project

Created a new directory named sample_project for my code.
Inside the project directory, created a simple Python script named hello_world.py with the following content
Python
print("Hello, World!")
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Opened the project in Visual Studio Code.




Overall, setting up the development environment was a smooth process. However, there were a few minor challenges



Understanding Git Commands: As a beginner with Git, I had to refer to the Git documentation (https://www.git-scm.com/doc) to understand commands like git add, git commit e.t.c

This experience helped me solidify my understanding of development environment setup and version control using Git.
